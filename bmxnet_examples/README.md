# BMXNet v2 Examples // Hasso Plattner Institute

This repository contains binary models, based on original mxnet architectures and others.
Note, that not all models and changes are documented completely.

Examples for hyperparameters are documented in the [Wiki](https://github.com/hpi-xnor/BMXNet-v2-wiki).

## Datasets

Files for CIFAR10 or MNIST will be downloaded automatically before training.

We use record files of mxnet for training imagenet.
Therefore, you will need to create them before training.
Please use the [official guide](https://mxnet.incubator.apache.org/tutorials/vision/large_scale_classification.html) or the guide from [Gluon-CV](https://gluon-cv.mxnet.io/build/examples_datasets/recordio.html#imagerecord-file-for-imagenet) to do that.
